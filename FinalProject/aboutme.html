      In her free time, Robyn loves to snuggle with her dog, listen to true crime podcasts, and binge watch TV shows. Robyn is 
      passionate about many issues and spends her free time doing historical research on subjects of interest. She is also close with
      her sisters and many nieces and nephews. In May she will be helping her nephew paint a mural at his school
