#Final Assignment

I know this wasn't required in the final assignment, but I really wanted to thank you for all of your feedback throughout the semester. I have really enjoyed this class and the materials we learned. I loved coding a website when we did it in Creative Coding and I am so happy I got to take a class that expanded upon.
