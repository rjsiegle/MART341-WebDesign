## Three things I've learned in MART 341

1. I learned about DNS and IP relationships. I knew a little bit but not how they worked together.

2. I use reddit so I was familiar with markdowns, but I didn't realize *how much* they could be used with Visual Studio Code.

3. I wasn't aware about the extensions offered in studio code, so that is entirely new and seeing the **Markdown Preview Enhanced** extension makes me very happy.
