#Assignment Overview #14

User Testing Sessions:

My user testing sessions went well. I asked both my sister and boyfriend to be critical so that I could make changes based upon their suggestions. I did make a few changes based upon those.

1. Added video intro screen as the index. This introduces the viewer to the  page instead of taking them directly into the works.
<br/>
2. Switched positions of photoshop website layout design because both my users stated they believed it to be an ad (yay, I guess that means it looks professional).
<br/>
3. Rewrote the page to be in 3rd person instead of 1st person per my sisters suggestion.
<br/>
4. Rewrote the style page to explain why it was there. It is mostly there to serve as an example that inspiration can be drawn from anywhere. 
<br/>
5. My boyfriend was confused by the hover option so I added a little statement about what that does. I like it and didn't want to remove it, so I chose to explain it instead of removing it.
<br/>
I didn't really encounter many challenges this week. I've been working on pulling my website together in past weeks so this was relatively easy to fix based upon the suggestions I was given.
