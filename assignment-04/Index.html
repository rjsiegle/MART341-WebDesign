<h1>Robyn Siegle - Assignment Four</h1>
<h2>The Experiment</h2>
<p> This is an experiment. I am going to write a short story. It is not a particularly
    interesting story, but it is something which fills up some space. Please feel free 
    to skip because there is nothing of great importance included.</p>

<p>It was a hot and smoky day in early September. My next door neighbors 
    had decided to have a garage sale. While I support their decision to purge
    their unneccessary household items, I don't particularly like a bunch of strangers
    leering at me while I take my dog outside. </p>

<p>Like the socially anxious person I am, I decided the best course of action was to hide on the side of 
    of my garage... as any self respecting adult does. Unfortunately, I found out the hard way 
    that strangers leering at me is preferrable to what happened while I hid. As I cowered 
    a big hairy spider dropped from the eaves and fell into my hair. Not only did I make my 
    presence known to the bargain shoppers, but I screamed so fearfully, that the whole neighborhood
    probably worried a crime was being committed. That was the day that I learned sometimes 
    hiding from things you dislike may result in a spider falling into your hair.</p>
